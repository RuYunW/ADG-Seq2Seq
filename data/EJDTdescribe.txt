Apply rotation about the Z axis to this matrix by rotating the given amount of radians. <p> When used with a right-handed coordinate system, the produced rotation will rotate a vector  counter-clockwise around the rotation axis, when viewing along the negative axis direction towards the origin. When used with a left-handed coordinate system, the rotation is clockwise. <p> If <code>M</code> is <code>this</code> matrix and <code>R</code> the rotation matrix, then the new matrix will be <code>M * R</code>. So when transforming a vector <code>v</code> with the new matrix by using <code>M * R * v</code>, the rotation will be applied first! <p> Reference: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#Basic_rotations">http://en.wikipedia.org</a>
